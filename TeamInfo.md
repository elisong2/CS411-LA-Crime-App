## Project Summary

  Los Angeles has a significant crime problem with over 123,000 a year, which greatly exceeds that of cities with comparable size. The focus of this project is to compile large amounts of data to help investigators find hotspots that the crime is originating from, which would allow the LAPD to more efficiently attack the issue. It will be presented via a web application with an interactive map. One of our focuses is on where the most firearms have been used. This information could be used to track down arms dealers and where they engage in transactions, so the LAPD can target more dealers while spending less time searching. We also plan to create a metric that combines the number of violent crimes and the severity of the crimes for a specific area (both will be calculated per capita). Based on the metric, that area will be shaded a certain color on a map that the LAPD could use to better understand where to allocate more or less resources. We also plan to allow the user to filter the crimes on the map by a variety of parameters such as time of day, victim information, and in what type of establishment the crime occurred. With access to this data, it will make it much easier for the LAPD to target crime-ridden neighborhoods, and give them a briefing on what to expect before tackling the crime head on.
